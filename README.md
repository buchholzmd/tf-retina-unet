# U-net for segmentation of retinal blood vessel (TensorFlow)

This is a re-implementation of the Orobix's retina-unet model for retina blood vessel segmentation using Tensorflow rather than Keras. In addition, all pre-processing was implemented from scratch, with the exception of the CLAHE method. All code was implemented using the Orobix project only as a reference. This project is for academic purposes only.
